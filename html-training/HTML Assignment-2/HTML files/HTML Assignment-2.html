<hr>

<h4>
    This webpage demonstrates the use of named anchors in HTML.
    Named anchors help users navigate within the same webpage.
    They are especially useful when the webpage contains large content.
    Instead of scrolling manually, users can jump to sections directly.
    This improves usability and user experience.
    Named anchors are commonly used in documentation pages.
    They are also useful in FAQs and long articles.
    In this example, department sections are linked.
    Each section contains detailed information.
    Clicking a link scrolls the page automatically.
</h4>

<h4>
    The following sections describe different engineering departments.
    Each department is represented using a named anchor.
    The anchor is linked using the href attribute.
    Classes are used only for styling and grouping.
    Navigation does not work using class alone.
    The name attribute enables scrolling behavior.
    Enough content is added for visible scrolling.
    This makes the demonstration clear and effective.
    Such examples are commonly asked in practical exams.
    This format is ideal for lab records and viva.
